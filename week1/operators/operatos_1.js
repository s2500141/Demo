/*
1. Create two variables, a and b, and assign them integer values (e.g., 8 and 3).
2. Perform the following operations using a and b, and store the results in separate variables:
- Add the values (sum).
- Subtract b from a (difference).
- Multiply the values (product).
- Divide a by b (quotient).
- Find the remainder when a is divided by b (remainder).
3. Use console.log() to print the resuls of each operation. For example, print: "The sum of a and b is: 11"
4. Add comments to explain what each operation does.
5. Change the values of a and b and observe how the results change.
6. Try the same operations with one positive and one negative number.
